/* simple-cat.c, O_SYNC version
 *
 * Use this program to illustrate the use of fcntl(2)
 * to set the O_SYNC flag on STDOUT, which we do not
 * open ourselves, so can't set that flag on at that
 * time.
 *
 * This also illustrates the difference between
 * synchronous and asynchronous I/O:
 *
 * Create a large enough file:
 *
 * dd if=/dev/zero of=file bs=$((1024 * 1024)) count=25
 *
 * Then run this program:
 *
 * time ./a.out <file >out
 *
 * Then, comment out the setting of O_SYNC, recompile
 * the program and run it again.
