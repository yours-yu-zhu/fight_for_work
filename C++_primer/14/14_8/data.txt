I don’t understand the point of garden visits. Why do ordinary people, the
owners of mere balconies and tiny yards, torment themselves by touring 
other people’s grand estates? Nut trees, stables, ancestral compost 
heaps: I need no reminder of what I am missing. So, unlike virtually every
other gardener in Britain, I had no intention of spending my summer
wandering among aristocratic roses and marvelling at the fine tilth of
Lord Whatsit’s sandy carrot beds. All those rambling sweet peas make me 
furious; yes, Tristram, it is a handsome cardoon bed, but some of us are 
struggling to find space for a single extra lettuce. And then, wholly by 
accident, I found myself in the Lost Gardens of Heligan.
